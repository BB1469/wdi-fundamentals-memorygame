			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
			<h2>Game</h2>
			<p>Concentration is a card game where all of the cards are shuffled and are laid face down on a surface in orderly rows and columns.  All of the cards must have a mate (pairs).  Each turn, two cards are flipped over.  If the cards do not match, they are both turned back face down.  If the cards match, they are left face up and the person who made the match receives a point.  With a regular deck of cards, the pair is considered the card with the same color and number (so the ace of hearts matches the ace of diamonds).  Concentration can be played with regular playing cards or with special themed cards.  It can be played by 1, 2, 3 or 4 people.  More than 4 people can be divided into teams.  It's a terrific game for young children and young at heart who want to stay young forever!</p>
